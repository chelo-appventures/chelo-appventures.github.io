The space and defense company is based in East Syracuse, New York. I was
        hired to assist with their website redesign.</p> <br> <p class="text-white">The site was built using
        Drupal and a customized theme and took around 6 months. My
        responsibilities included styling the frontend and constructing data
        tables for their products. I collaborated with a team of developers,
        designers, and marketers to develop a responsive and user-friendly
        website. This project was distinctive in the sense that the site
        information was sourced from various stakeholders across different
        departments of the company.</p> <p class="mb-6 text-gray-300 md:text-lg">
